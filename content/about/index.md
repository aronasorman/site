Aron Asor rides bicycles and reads books. Sometimes he climbs things. His urban planning interests manifest in counting bike lanes and muttering about street design. He writes poems when no one is looking. He owns multiple devices capable of connecting to the internet. Friends describe his humor as "present, technically." He has never once pretended to be a potted plant, though the thought has occurred.

His colleagues suspect his infrastructure monitoring alerts are set to the tune of sad indie songs, but no one has been brave enough to confirm this theory.
